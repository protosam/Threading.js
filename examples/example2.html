	/* Functions Example of Threading.js
	   ---------------------------------
	   You can just do `X = new Threading(function_name);` and Threading will just shove it into
	   a blob and consume it. In the example below, we're just passing an anonymous function to
	   Threading.js and the helpers are automatically going to be added to it. Inside the function
	   we pass to Threading.js we should be able to declare variables, more functions, and even
	   classes to use. 
	   
	   Below we are going to just stuf things into an Anonymous function for our Worker Thread.
	   Just bear in mind that this is probably not great if you want to work on a team with
	   other people.
	 */
	anonW = new Threading(function(){
		/* This will become the main scope of the Worker Thread. You can
		   declare variables and whatnot here and they run in-line however
		   you arrange them. Above all of this, the helper_functions will
		   be added by Threading.js */
		console.log("This is the main scope of the Worker Thread...");

		/* make a function named a_function_in_a_thread() that can be used from the main thread (window).
		   pretty much the same as in our class, but with FUNCTION jammed in front */
		function a_function_in_a_thread(message){
			console.log("Received message: " + message);
			console.log("This message was just logged from inside the Worker Thread.");

			/* request a callback to window.a_function_in_the_window()... window is not really window though */
			root.a_function_in_the_window();
		}

		/* This is still the main scope here as well. */
	});

	/* Try out calling a method of your function that is now inside the Worker Thread. */
	anonW.a_function_in_a_thread("Hey Anonymous function(){}...");

	<p>In this example, create a worker from an anonymous function. Pretty straight forward.</p>
